In order to make the program actually change any digital io, The DRY_RUN define needs to be removed ( //#define DRY_RUN ) from PurpleMow.c

To test the CLI:

 Start the server:
  Use start.sh, it compiles, removes any old socket, and starts the server (which handles the digital IO)

  The server runs in the foreground for now, in the future it will be a daemonized process.

 Use the client:
  Send CMD_WRITE MOTOR_RIGHT 1
  sudo ./mowcli 201
  
  Read voltage sensor (does not yet read an actual sensor value)
  sudo ./mowcli 42
